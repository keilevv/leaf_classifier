This document explains how to enable HTTPS for the `leaf-frontend` service using an automatic nginx reverse proxy + Let's Encrypt companion.

Overview
- We'll add an nginx-proxy (jwilder/nginx-proxy) that routes by VIRTUAL_HOST.
- We'll use nginxproxy/acme-companion to request and renew Let's Encrypt certificates automatically.
- The frontend container will not publish port 80 directly; the proxy will expose ports 80 and 443 and handle TLS.

Prerequisites
- Your DNS record for the domain (e.g. plantai.lab.utb.edu.co) must point to the host running Docker.
- Ports 80 and 443 must be reachable from the internet.

Environment variables
- VIRTUAL_HOST: Domain for the frontend (default: plantai.lab.utb.edu.co)
- LETSENCRYPT_HOST: Domain for Let's Encrypt (same as VIRTUAL_HOST)
- LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL: Email used for Let's Encrypt registration/renewal notices

Quick steps
1. Set environment variables for production (or export them before running docker-compose):

   export VIRTUAL_HOST=plantai.lab.utb.edu.co
   export LETSENCRYPT_HOST=plantai.lab.utb.edu.co
   export LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=admin@plantai.lab.utb.edu.co

2. Start the stack (preferably with the updated `docker-compose.prod.yml`):

   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d nginx-proxy nginx-letsencrypt

   Wait until both containers are healthy and the acme-companion logs show successful provisioning.

3. Start the frontend (and other services):

   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d backend classifier frontend db

4. Check logs for certificate issuance:

   docker logs -f nginx-letsencrypt

   You should see messages about issuing certificates for your domain. The certificates are stored in the `certs` volume and automatically mounted into `nginx-proxy`.

5. Verify HTTPS from a remote machine (or locally if DNS resolves):

   curl -I https://plantai.lab.utb.edu.co

   Or open https://plantai.lab.utb.edu.co in a browser.

Notes and troubleshooting
- If certificates are not issued, check Let's Encrypt rate limits and DNS accuracy.
- Make sure `docker` has permission to read/write the sockets and volumes.
- If you want to use your own certificate, place the key and fullchain at `certs/<domain>.key` and `certs/<domain>.crt` on the host (or inside the `certs` volume) and reload the proxy.

Security
- Keep your `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` valid to receive expiry notices.
- Monitor the `nginx-letsencrypt` container and renewals.

Advanced
- You can use Traefik instead of nginx-proxy for advanced routing and HTTP->HTTPS redirect rules.
- If your server is behind a firewall or NAT, ensure ports are forwarded.

That's it â€” this setup will automatically provision certificates and keep them renewed while the companion is running.
